      <h2>Dear God</h2>
      <p>Peggy went to church every Sunday. She loved to go to church. At church she was with her family and friends. At church she was with the saints. She was with the angels. And most of all, Peggy was with God. She always talked to God in church. She always asked God to stop war. She asked God to stop hate. She asked God to stop sickness. But war and hate and sickness did not stop. There were war and hate and sickness every day. "Mommy, why doesn't God stop war and hate and sickness?" Peggy asked. "God will," her mom said, "when more people ask."</p>
